# Plunter-Plant-Health-Gen-AI-Robot-
Plunter is a robot that collects data from a plant and other variables and then returns that data and expresses it via voicelines.
How to use: 
Plunter uses an Arduino Uno and a Rassberry Pi, the Arduino is connected to a photoresistor and a water sensor, and a ultrasonic sensor.
The arduino connects to the rassberry pi using serial port and has a python script that handles the data sent from arduino IDE and outputs voicelines.
There are only two scripts in this project right now. In this repository I have provided the scripts, pinout, and additional information and voicelines.
